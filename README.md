# Team Delta Project

This is the project for team Delta of CMPT 373's fall 2017 offering, and the latest version is hosted at http://cmpt373-1177d.cmpt.sfu.ca:8080.

## Setting up the Database

I'm taking sections from this tutorial: https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-mysql/

Open your MySql client in the terminal. On Linux, you can do this with the following command:

```sh
$ sudo mysql --password
```

Then run the following commands to create a database and user

```sh
mysql> create database db_example; -- Create the new database
mysql> create user 'springuser'@'localhost' identified by 'ThePassword'; -- Creates the user
mysql> grant all on db_example.* to 'springuser'@'localhost';
```

## Running Web Application

First, we need to set up the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to reflect database properties. Copy 
and paste the following into it, if it doesn't already exist. Notice the username and password and database name is 
the same from the previous section.

```shell
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/db_example
spring.datasource.username=springuser
spring.datasource.password=ThePassword
```

**Note:** Don't change the `application.properties` file in `src/test/resources`. This is file is only for tests.

Build this application with [gradle](https://gradle.org/install/), and run the resulting jar file.

On Linux you may do this in the terminal:
```
$ gradle build
$ java -jar build/libs/*.jar
```

With the application running, open your browser to http://localhost:8080 to see the main page. From here you can create a form, and submit it to save it to your local database. To see all forms that have been saved to your local database, navigate to http://localhost:8080/requests.

## Directory Structure
Our directory structure is as follows:
`Documentation/` has the outline of our database inside.
`src/` follows the industry standard for our java code
Everything else is build related (.gradle and node_modules)

## Intergration
The parameter `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` should only be set to `create` for the first time the server is run.
After that it should be set to `none`. According to spring.io guides, the following are the possible values for the parameter.
```
none:           This is the default for MySQL, no change to the database structure.
update:         Hibernate changes the database according to the given Entity structures.
create:         Creates the database every time, but donâ€™t drop it when close.
create-drop:    Creates the database then drops it when the SessionFactory closes.
```
If the server is restarted with the parameter set to `create`, all data in the database tables will be erased.

## Dependencies
Gradle, Java 8, mysql
